  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Automation</strong>- AI makes sense of machines to interpret the situation and take necessary action. Some tasks can be tedious, like checking papers, submitting forms, etc., and these tasks can be automated with the help of AI with minimal human intervention. Employees in an organization/industry can focus on their core responsibility, whereas AI can automate difficult tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed</strong>- AI can do many things without stopping as compared to humans. In addition to automation, AI lets us complete work before the deadline, and work can be done outside working hours, and this reduces not only human labor but also provides great speed and efficiency.</li>
  <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>- AI reduces the chance of error as compared to humans. There are fewer errors because the machine will always act according to the fixed AI algorithm in every scenario. AI helps us define new boundaries of accuracy and precision with less risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Exploration</strong>- Artificial Intelligence has helped us to discover many unexplored places like volcanic sites, ocean floors, etc. Humans cannot visit these vulnerable sites because they cannot survive in those landscapes, and AI machines can visit such sensitive places and collect information.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Collection and Analysis</strong> - Data analytics is already a trending technology in the modern-day business world. Industries and businesses know the importance of analyzing large chunks of data and extracting useful information from it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The various benefits of AI lead to different use cases and job roles in the market, which are beneficial for deep tech enthusiasts or those new to pursuing a career in the AI industry. The scope of AI in India is bright as firms need expert employees who can extract meaningful information from large chunks of data.</p>
  <h3 class="h3">What are the risks associated with AI?</h3>
  <p>Are you aware of the risks associated with AI and how to manage them? A beginner should be aware of the potential risks associated with AI processes and how to deal with them. Some of the common risks associated with AI are as follows:</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>High Implementation Cost</strong> - Do you want to install chatbot software for your firm/business? The implementation cost of AI is high compared to setting up other technologies like cloud technology, database, etc. A subset of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning also have high implementation costs. Why do firms still opt for AI despite the high implementation cost?</li>
  <li>This is because almost every business has realized the future scope of Artificial Intelligence. Although its implementation cost is high, an AI setup can help you in the long run, and it is sure to save you money and resources by reducing the reliance on human labor in your organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Replication</strong> - It all started in <strong>1950</strong> when Alan Turing conducted the 'Turing Test' to define the ability to think in machines. Since then, the replication of human intelligence using AI has been constantly debated. The bright realm of Artificial Intelligence also comes with its risks which have to be handled by AI experts.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="h3">What are the applications of AI?</h3>
  <p>AI has its application in every conceivable field or area, and recent advances will only increase the application and relevance of AI in almost every field of human activity. As a beginner, you might think that AI is a newly developed technology, and AI has been under development for longer than you might think. Some of the top use cases of AI are as follows:</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Speech Recognition</strong> - AI has helped us convert spoken words into digital text. Speech recognition has many uses, such as voice-enabled messaging, content writing, voice-controlled remotes, and devices. Speech recognition is also used for authorization and verification.<br>
  <strong>For example</strong>, if an office is accessed only by authorized persons, speech recognition may match their voice and authority. If any unauthorized person tries to enter the office, they will be stopped as their voice sample will not match.</li>
  <li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> - NLP (Natural Language Processing) enables a system or machine to understand the human text. You must have heard about some major virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, etc. Virtual Assistants and Chatbots work on the principle of NLP and understand the emotion and mood of their users.</li>
  <li><strong>Image Recognition</strong> - Recently, a platform called 'MyHeritage' allowed its users to animate old photos. It uses AI and deep neural networks to animate faces in still photos, and AI can understand actions in video footage or still images. Image recognition has many applications such as facial recognition, fingerprint ID, self-driving vehicles, etc. Image recognition is also heavily used in the digital marketing space.</li>
  <li>AI can sense stock market volatility and predict high-return stocks with greater accuracy than humans. The future scope of Artificial Intelligence in the finance sector is also expanding as cryptocurrency trading grows.</li>
  <li><strong>Robots</strong>- Have you heard of the new generation 'Sofia' robot? It is considered one of the most intelligent robots in the world. Apart from developing highly intelligent robots, AI has also helped create robots that can assist humans in routine tasks like <strong>cleaning, gardening, servicing</strong>, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These were only the top use cases for AI in the current scenario. AI has many other use cases such as autopilot technology in <strong>vehicles, ride-booking services, cyber security</strong>, etc.</p>
  <h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Recently, businesses have seen a massive exposure to <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>ML</strong> phenomena as they explore their application possibilities in various fields.
