  <h2 class="h2">Essay on Artificial Intelligence</h2>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Introduction: What is Artificial Intelligence?</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence is a combination of two words Artificial and Intelligence, which refers to man-made intelligence. Therefore, when machines are equipped with man-made intelligence to perform intelligent tasks similar to humans, it is known as Artificial Intelligence. It is all about developing intelligent machines that can simulate the human brain and work &amp; behave like human beings.</p>
  <p>We can define AI as, "<strong><em>Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that deals with developing intelligent machines which can behave like human, think like human, and has ability to take decisions by their own</em></strong>."</p>
  <p>With AI, machines can have human-based skills such as learning, reasoning, and solving logical problems.</p>
  <p>AI is one of the fastest-growing technology that is making human life much easier by providing solutions for complex problems. It has also brought different opportunities for everyone, and hence it is a very demanding technology in the market.</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>History of Artificial Intelligence</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is assumed a new technology, but in reality, it is not new. The researchers in the field of AI are much older. It is said that the concept of intelligent machines was found in Greek Mythology. Below are some keystones in the development of AI:</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li>In the year 1943, <strong>Warren McCulloch</strong> and <strong>Walter pits</strong> proposed a model of Artificial neurons.</li>
  <li>In the year 1950, <strong>Alan Turing published</strong> a "Computer Machinery and Intelligence" paper in which he introduced a test, known as a <strong>Turing Test.</strong> This test is used to determine intelligence in machines by checking if the machine is capable of thinking or not.</li>
  <li>In the year 1956, for the first time, the term Artificial Intelligence was coined by the American Computer scientist <strong>John McCarthy</strong> at the Dartmouth Conference. John McCarthy is also known as the <strong>Father of AI.</strong></li>
  <li>In the year 1972, the first full-scale intelligent humanoid robot<strong>, WABOT1,</strong> was created in Japan.</li>
  <li>In the year 1980, AI came with the evolution of Expert Systems. These systems are computer programs, which are designed to solve complex problems.</li>
  <li>In the year 1997, IBM Deep Blue beat world chess champion Gary Kasparov and became the first computer to defeat a world chess champion.</li>
  <li>In the year <strong>2006</strong>, AI came into the business world. World's top companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix also started using AI in their applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Advantages &amp; disadvantages of AI</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="h3">Advantages:</h3>
  <ul class="points">
  <li>One of the biggest achievements of Artificial Intelligence is that it can reduce human error.</li>
  <li>AI can be very helpful in risky situations where humans can't reach or find difficult survival. Such as exploring the deepest part of the sea.</li>
  <li>With AI, 24*7 support can be provided to the customers using chatbots as customer care.</li>
  <li>Repetitive actions can be boring for human beings, but with AI-enabled machines, they can be performed with full efficiency.</li>
  <li>It is very helpful in daily activities, such as Google Assistant Alexa, and other virtual assistant technology are helping to make our life easier.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="h3">Disadvantages:</h3>
  <ul class="points">
  <li>The development and maintenance of AI systems are very expensive.</li>
  <li>The dependencies of human beings on such technologies making humans lazy.</li>
  <li>There is always a fear with AI that if it gets advanced, it may be harmful to humanity.</li>
  <li>If inputs are not fed correctly to AI systems, then it may cause harmful results.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Types of AI</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/artificial-intelligence-essay2.png" alt="Artificial Intelligence Essay">
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>On the basis of Capability, AI can be divided into mainly three types</strong>:</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>1. Narrow AI or Weak AI:</strong> Narrow AI or Weak AI is a basic kind of Artificial Intelligence, which is capable of completing dedicated tasks with intelligence. The current version of AI is narrow AI.</p>
  <p>Narrow AI can only perform the specific task and not beyond its limitation, as they are trained for one task only. It is programmed to do a specific task such as Play Chess, Checking Weather, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>2. General AI:</strong> </p>
  <p>Artificial General intelligence or "Strong" AI defines the machines that can show human intelligence. We can say, Machines with AGI can successfully perform any intellectual task that a human can do. This is the sort of AI that we see in movies like "Her" or other sci-fi movies in which humans interact with machines and operating systems that are conscious, sentient, and driven by emotion and self-awareness.</p>
  <p>Currently, this type of intelligence does not exist in the real world and only exist in researches and movies. However, researchers across the world are working to develop such machines, which is still a very difficult task.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Super AI</strong></p>
  <p>Super AI refers to AI that is self-aware, with cognitive abilities that surpass that of humans. It is a level where machines are capable of doing any task that a human can do with cognitive properties. However, Super AI is still a hypothetical concept, and it is a challenging task to develop such AI-enabled machines.</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>On the basis of Functionality:</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>1. Reactive Machines</strong></p>
  <p>Reactive machines are the basic types of AI, which don't store memories or past experiences for their actions. These types of AI machines only focus on current scenarios and work as per the requirement with the best possible actions. IBM's Deep Blue is an example of a reactive machine.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Limited Memory</strong></p>
  <p>Limited memory can store some memory or past experiences for a limited time period. Some examples of limited memory are Self-driving cars.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Theory of Mind</strong></p>

  <li><strong>Prerequisites for Artificial Intelligence</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a beginner, below are some of the prerequisites that will help to get started with AI technology.</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li>Strong knowledge of Mathematics mainly, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics and probability.</li>
  <li>A good experience in programming languages like Java, Python, R.</li>
  <li>A strong understanding of algorithms.</li>
  <li>Good background in data analytics skills.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Challenges with AI</strong>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Lack of data or poor-quality data</strong></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>One of the big challenges with AI is that we don't have enough data to work with AI systems, or data we have is of poor quality or unstructured. AI depends on data for its working and requires a huge amount of data for a good result, but in the real world, data is available either in raw form or unstructured form that contains lots of impurities and missing values that cannot be processed or analyzed. Hence the processing of such data is a big task for organizations, and it takes lots of effort and is a time-consuming process.</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Insufficient IT infrastructure</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is still a lack of IT infrastructures, mainly in start-ups, which is a big issue in AI researches and development.</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Lack of AI talent</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>AI is growing continuously day by day with rapid speed, and more people are accepting the proven ideas of AI. The growing rate of AI also needs developers of AI tech. However, the professionals with full scales skills to develop high-level AI implementations are still lacking, which is also one of the big challenges with AI.</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Computing Power</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Computing power has always been a big issue in the IT industry, but day by day, this issue has been resolved. However, with the development of AI, this issue has arisen again. Deep learning and the processing of neural networks, which are part of AI, require a high level of computing power, and are a major challenge for the tech industries. Mainly for start-ups, collecting money and such high computing power to process the data is a big deal.</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Legal Issues</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>One of the latest challenges with AI is that now organizations need to be wary of AI. The legal issues are raised for concern that if AI collects sensitive data, that may be a violation of federal laws.</p>
  <p>Although it is not illegal, industries need to be careful of any supposed impact that might negatively affect their organization.</p>
  <ul class="points">
  <li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly a trending and emerging technology. It is growing very fast day by day, <em>and it is enabling machines to mimic the human brain.</em> Due to its high performance and as it is making human life easier, it is becoming a highly demanded technology among industries. However, there are also some challenges and problems with AI. Many people around the world are still thinking of it as a risky technology, because they feel that if it overtakes humans, it will be dangerous for humanity, as shown in various sci-fi movies. However, the day-to-day development of AI is making it a comfortable technology, and people are connecting with it more. Therefore, we can conclude that it is a great technology, but each technique must be used in a limited way in order to be used effectively, without any harm.</p>
