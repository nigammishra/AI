          <h2><strong>What is Deep Learning?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
          <p>Deep learning is the branch of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> which is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.</p>
          <p>In a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.</p><div id="_GFG_ABP_Incontent_728x90" style="text-align:center;"></div>

          <p>Today Deep learning has become one of the most popular and visible areas of machine learning, due to its success in a variety of applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and Reinforcement learning.</p>
          <p>Deep learning can be used for supervised, unsupervised as well as reinforcement machine learning. it uses a variety of ways to process these.</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Supervised Machine Learning:</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-unsupervised-learning/">Supervised machine learning</a> is the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> technique in which the neural network learns to make predictions or classify data based on the labeled datasets. Here we input both input features along with the target variables. the neural network learns to make predictions based on the cost or error that comes from the difference between the predicted and the actual target, this process is known as backpropagation. &nbsp;Deep learning algorithms like Convolutional neural networks, Recurrent neural networks are used for many supervised tasks like image classifications and recognization, sentiment analysis, language translations, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Unsupervised Machine Learning:</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-unsupervised-learning/">Unsupervised machine learning</a> is the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> technique in which the neural network learns to discover the patterns or to cluster the dataset based on unlabeled datasets. Here there are no target variables. while the machine has to self-determined the hidden patterns or relationships within the datasets. Deep learning algorithms like autoencoders and generative models are used for unsupervised tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforcement &nbsp;Machine Learning</strong>: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-reinforcement-learning/">Reinforcement &nbsp;Machine Learning</a> is the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> technique in which an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent interacts with the environment by taking action and observing the resulting rewards. Deep learning can be used to learn policies, or a set of actions, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q networks and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are used to reinforce tasks like robotics and game playing etc.</li>

          <h3>Artificial neural networks</h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-neural-networks-and-its-applications/">Artificial neural networks</a> are built on the principles of the structure and operation of human neurons. It is also known as neural networks or neural nets. An artificial neural network’s input layer, which is the first layer, receives&nbsp;input from external sources and passes it on to the hidden layer, which is the second layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer gets information from the neurons in the previous layer, computes the weighted total, and then transfers it to the neurons in the next layer. These connections are weighted, which means that the impacts of the inputs from the preceding layer are more or less optimized by giving each input a distinct weight. These weights are then adjusted during the training process to enhance the performance of the model.</p><div id="GFG_AD_Desktop_InContent_ATF_336x280" style="text-align:center;max-height: 280px;"></div>
          <div style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211226150052/kisspngdeeplearningartificialneuralnetworkmachineleneurons5adb77d61591897756916615243325020884.png" alt="Fully Connected Artificial Neural Network - Geeksforgeeks" width="530"><p class="wp-caption-text">Fully Connected Artificial Neural Network</p></div>
          <p>Artificial neurons, also known as units, are found in artificial neural networks. The whole Artificial Neural Network&nbsp;is composed&nbsp;of these artificial neurons, which are arranged in a series of layers. The complexities of neural networks will depend on the complexities&nbsp;of&nbsp;the underlying patterns in the dataset whether a layer has a dozen units or millions of units. &nbsp;Commonly, Artificial Neural Network has an input layer, an output layer as well as hidden layers. The input layer receives data from the outside world which the neural network needs to analyze or learn about.</p>
          <p>In a fully connected artificial neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. Then, after passing through one or more hidden layers, this data is transformed into valuable data for the output layer.&nbsp;Finally,&nbsp;the output layer provides an output in the form of an artificial neural network’s response to the data that comes in.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Units are linked to one another from one layer to another in the bulk of neural networks. Each of these links has weights that control how much one unit influences another. The neural network learns more and more about the data as it moves from one unit to another, ultimately producing an output from the output layer.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/">machine learning</a> and deep learning both are subsets of artificial intelligence but there are many similarities and differences between them.</p>

          <h3>Disadvantages of Deep Learning:</h3>
          <ol>
          <li>High computational requirements: Deep Learning models require large amounts of data and computational resources to train and optimize.</li>
          <li>Requires large amounts of labeled data: Deep Learning models often require a large amount of labeled data for training, which can be expensive and time- consuming to acquire.</li>
          <li>Interpretability: Deep Learning models can be challenging to interpret, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions.<br>Overfitting: Deep Learning models can sometimes overfit to the training data, resulting in poor performance on new and unseen data.</li>
          <li>Black-box nature: Deep Learning models are often treated as black boxes, making it difficult to understand how they work and how they arrived at their predictions.<br>In summary, while Deep Learning offers many advantages, including high accuracy and scalability, it also has some disadvantages, such as high computational requirements, the need for large amounts of labeled data, and interpretability challenges. These limitations need to be carefully considered when deciding whether to use Deep Learning for a specific task.</li>
