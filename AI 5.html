           Over the past decade, there has been no sign of slowing down data generation. It is generated in quintillions daily but is unstructured, raw, and noisy. It needs to be converted into a meaningful and understandable form to make the most out of the data. This is where the role of data science comes into play.

          <p>
           With technological advancements, there has been a proliferation in the inception and use of devices that automatically collect user data. Social media platforms, online stores, payment apps, and many other online systems gather extensive amounts of data. As a result, organizations today are always flooded with loads of data.

          </h3>
          <p>
           The first step involves acquiring data based on the question(s) you need to answer. The project begins with identifying various data sources like logs from
           <a href="https://www.techgeekbuzz.com/blog/what-is-web-server/">
            web servers
           </a>
           , social media data, online repositories or excel, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Data acquisition involves acquiring data from all the identified internal and external sources that can help answer the business question(s). It is important to track where the data slice comes from and whether it is up-to-date. It is recommended to track this information during the entire lifecycle of a data science project, as data might need to be re-acquired to test other hypotheses.

           . Now comes the role of data scientists. They clean data and transform it into a standard format. Through regular data cleaning, data scientists can easily identify the following:

          <ul>
           <li>
            Foibles that exist in the data acquisition process,

            Models they could apply to produce results.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Further, they load the refined and transformed data into any one of the

           Such programs are often written in Python, Perl,

           </strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
           After we get the set of process-ready data, we need to analyze it. It involves analysis of the random subset of data. This is a brainstorming stage for data analysts as this is where the patterns in the data are observed, and useful insights are retrieved.
          </p>
          <p>
           There could be a possibility that the dataset could be missing values or there is some unnecessary (dispensable) data. Such inconsistencies are identified and removed in this stage.

           The goal of this stage is to deploy the models into production for the final user acceptance. The user must validate the models' performance; if any issues exist, they must fix them in this stage. A data science project is an iterative process. Steps are iteratively repeated as data is acquired continuously, and understanding becomes much easier.

           Unlike data science, which uses structured and unstructured data, business intelligence uses only structured data. Also, BI is analytical in nature. This means that it provides historical reports of data.
          </p>
          <p>
           In contrast, data science is scientific in nature as it performs in-depth statistical analysis on the datasets. Further, it leverages more sophisticated statistical and predictive analysis and machine learning, whereas business intelligence uses basic statistics emphasizing visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lastly, business intelligence compares historical data and current data to identify trends. Contrary to this, data science combines historical and current data to predict future performance, possibilities, and outcomes.

            How does Data Science Differ From Data Analytics?
           </strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
           We use both these terms interchangeably for collecting, processing, analyzing, and deriving insights from large data sets. The primary difference is that data science is an umbrella term, while data analytics is associated with statistics, mathematics, and statistical analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
           Data analytics primarily focuses on data analysis, while data science associates with a broader picture of the organizational data. It is a technique to examine data sets and generate insights by connecting and observing patterns in trends to achieve organizational targets.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unlike data science, it involves dealing with historical data in context and less in AI, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

            data scientists and data analysts
           </a>
           work together. Data analysts focus on routine analysis and provide regular reports. In addition to this, data scientists create new data models, write algorithms, and generate new tools and methods for data analysts.

            How does Data Science Differ from Machine Learning?
           </strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
           Machine learning is a computer science discipline that trains machines to understand and analyze data independently and provide accurate predictions. It enables machines to mimic human intelligence. It is one of the methods used in data science to drive valuable insights from data.
          </p>
          <p>
           Data scientists generally combine machine learning with mathematics, statistics, and other fields to process data.
